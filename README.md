<h1>Google Fonts</h1>

This module enables you to add Google Fonts to your site using the Google Font API.

It is a port to BackdropCMS of the Drupal project, version 7.x-2.3

Note that the author now recommends adopting the more general @font-your-face module that not only support Google Fonts, but also several other font providers and combines all those fonts in a very user-friendly interface.
